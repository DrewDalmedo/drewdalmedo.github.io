# Welcome

Welcome to my ongoing exploration of personal operations, systems thinking, and antifragile approaches to life and software development. This site serves as a personal knowledge repository of experimental and empirically-tested ideas.

## About These Notes

The notes here document my experiences with various systems and processes, with a particular focus on the intersection of Linux, Nix, and principled software development. Each entry represents tested approaches rather than theoretical ideals - I believe in learning through direct experience and careful observation.

### Philosophical Foundation

Much of my thinking is influenced by Nassim Nicholas Taleb's work on antifragility, via negativa, black swans, and the importance of "skin in the game." These principles shape not just how I approach software development, but how I document and share knowledge.

### Site Philosophy

Consider this site a living document - it will grow and evolve as I continue to test ideas and refine processes. Everything here is based on direct experience, with a focus on what actually works rather than what should work in theory.

## Important Note

These are empirical notes, not prescriptive guides. The approaches documented here represent what has worked in my specific context, based on direct experimentation and observation. Results may vary depending on the specifics of your circumstances, natural inclinations, etc. 

In other words: these guides aren't for everyone and shouldn't be taken as techno-gospel.
